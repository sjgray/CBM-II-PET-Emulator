8432 PET/CBM Emulator for CBM-II Computers
==========================================
Original program by N. Kuenne. Mods and instructions
by Steve Gray - Apr 1/2024

The "8432" Emulator is named because it can run on a CBM-II
computer that typically has 2 or 4 BANKS of 64K RAM and
each 64K BANK can be used to emulate one 8032 computer. So,
8432. In reality, the limit is not 4 machines but is in fact
determined by how many 64K BANKS of RAM that the computer
has. CBM-II machines can have up to 15 BANKS of RAM.

Currently, 8432 will run on a CBM-II B-series and emulate a
standard 80-column 8032 machine. Due to the B-Series running
at 2MHz, it can actually run PET programs faster than the
original machine!


Loading 8432
------------

To start 8432 insert the disk and press <SHIFT><RUN>. You
will be asked which BANKS you wish to use for emulation.
NOTE that B-series machines normally do not have a BANK 0.
Enter the start and end BANK numbers.

Next you are asked which Keyboard to use. You can select from
the following:

  "1"   - ANSI (North American)
  "2"   - ?
  "ALT" - ?
  "D"   - DIN (German)

Lastly, you will be asked if you want to use "40 column". This
option re-programs the screen to a 40-column mode before entering
emulation. When you enter emulation you must manually load the
"40col" program that will re-configure the PET system to work in
40 column mode and make the system appear to be a 4032 computer.
NOTE: this is not perfect. It doesn't actually change the characters
to be bigger, but simply changes the screen layout. Programs that
write directly to the screen expecting 40 columns will now work
properly, but this will cause problems with the Emulator menu, and
all emulation screens will be 40 columns so you can't mix 40 and 80
column emulation.

Once you've selected your options the program will load code into
selected BANK(s). This may take a while.


Running 8432
------------

When the emulator starts up for the first time it will take you
directly to the first BANK selected. You will see the following
banner:

     *** Commodore BASIC 4.0 ***  virtual machine 8432/x
      31743 bytes free

Where "x" is the bank#.

If you selected YES to using 40 columns then you should immediately
type:

      DLOAD"40COL
      RUN

Now you can use the computer just like you are using an 8032 or 4032
machine.


Switching BANKS
---------------

At any time you can press <SHIFT><CBM> to access the 8432 Emulator menu
where you can select a different BANK and run an entirely separate
emulation. NOTE that only one instance is running at a time.

You can also select "F" to enter the CBM-II Machine Language monitor.
To return to the emulator you must enter "X" to exit back to BASIC
then type:

        BANK15:SYS1024


Menu Features
-----------------

At the menu you can use the additional keys

  #x - Reset (Cold Start) BANK x.
  Wx - Enter MONITOR for BANK x.
  Px - Toggle Parallel processing (multi-tasking) for BANK x.

Advanced Emulation Features
---------------------------

While in emulation mode the following enhancements are available

  <CBM>       - pause scrolling
  <SHIFT><CE> - toggle screen mirroring/updating. When OFF the screen
                is not updated which will speed up execution.
