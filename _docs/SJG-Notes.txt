8432 Emulator for CBM-II B-series - Enhanced by Steve J. Gray
================================= - 2024-05-28

8432 Emulator by N. Kuenne, found on CBUG disk.

First mod by me, probably about 1987.

- Add some introductory help text.
- Add prompts for start and end banks
- Add ability to show directory using "?" as input to keyboard prompt
- Add prompt for 40-column mode.
- Add DATA for CBM-II CRTC registers to switch screen to 40-column.
- Add standard "80240.PRG" that switches 8032 to 40 column mode (mods the print routines too).
- Add loop to load files to selected banks. Displays "Loading..." info.

NOTE: Not all of these mods may be possible in the cartridge version.

PET and emulator code

- $8800-8FFF - reserved for Keyboard support code, loaded separately
- $9000-AFFF - reserved for option roms
- $B000-DFFF - BASIC 4
- $E000-E7FF - EDITOR ROM
- $E800-E8FF - IO Area
- $E900-EFFF - Emulator code
- $F000-FFFF - KERNAL

VICE Emulation Testing
----------------------

When testing in VICE autostart will not work if you boot into BASIC as it sets the
Warmstart Flag at $03FA. POKE 1018,0 to reset flag for testing.

TODO
----

* Needs to be analyzed to see what ROM code has been patched.
* Investigate support for alternate Editor ROMS.
* Investigate support for 4032 ROMS or 40-col routines.
* Investigate programming the screen for 40/80 automatically per BANK.
* See if can be run from cartridge (24K of ROM space in BANK 15).
  - Create versions with ANSI and DIN keyboards.
  - Add autostart. Boot to PET or over-ride to CBM-II mode.
  - How many BANKS to use?
* Idea: default load BANK1 only, which should be available for all systems.
        Mod menu to detect RAM. Show "FREE" or "N/A". If user selects a
        RAM bank that is FREE then prompt to load another instance.
