PET Emulator Cartridge For CBM-II B-Series - Steve J. Gray  sjgray@rogers.com
==========================================   www.cbmsteve.ca

The binaries folder contains the pet emulator files to burn to eprom. The emulator
takes up the entire 24K of cartridge space which is divided into three 8k files.
For cartridge PCB's you will pick ONE of the "2000" files that correspond to the
features that you want, plus the "4000" and "6000" files.

If you have one of my CBM-II cartridges with a single EEPROM you can use my MRB
(multi-rom builder) to place all 3 separate files into the ROM set in the correct
order along with any other roms you need.

I will try to provide pre-assembled ROM sets in the future.
